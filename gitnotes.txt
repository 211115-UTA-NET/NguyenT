the syntaxes of equations can be very jank (place spaces between equations or else it may not work as intended)

let addition=$x+$y
let subtract=$x-$y
let multiply=$x*$y
let divide=$x/$y
let modulus=$x%$y
the syntaxes of expressions can be very jank as well (do not place spaces between equations or else it may not work as intended)
